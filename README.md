# ASL-SignLanguage
Have used Kaggle asl dataset and built a model using cnn to give voice to the sign language. The link for the dataset used for this is "https://www.kaggle.com/grassknoted/asl-alphabet"
# Context
ASL data set is a collection of images of alphabets from the American Sign Language, separated in 29 folders which represents various classes.
# Content
The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING. These 3 classes are very helpful in real time applications, and classification. The test data set contains a mere 29 images, to encourage the use of real world test images. Libraries used for this project are pandas,os,numpy,sklearn,skimage,keras,cv2,etc.
